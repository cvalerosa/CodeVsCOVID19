The goal of #CodeVsCOVID19, a 72-hour nonprofit online hackathon, is to develop open-source prototypes, which contribute to solving the most pressing challenges in the current pandemic. We want to build on existing solutions and technologies to prevent duplications and want to enable a sustainable impact after the hackathon to take projects to the next level and implement them for our daily life and work.

> **Note:** This is an initiative under the patronage of the Swiss Federal Department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research (EAER) and the Federal Department of Home Affairs (FDHA).
